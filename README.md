# Privacy Listed
The simplest list of the best software to protect your privacy.
* * *
This list will categorize software into three principles:

 - Security: Refers to safeguarding personal information from unauthorized access or theft. It involves ensuring that data is protected and stored securely, making it difficult for malicious actors to access it.
-    Anonymity: Is about ensuring that actions cannot be traced back to the individual. This means that even if someone discovers what is being done, they will not be able to identify the source.
-    Privacy: Involves regulating who has access to personal information, being aware of the data being collected, and having control over who can access it and how. In short, privacy is about controlling personal information."
