   # Criteria
 To create a comprehensive list of privacy-focused software, we've established a set of transparent criteria that assess various aspects of software. These criteria are designed to provide a thorough understanding of each software's commitment to user privacy, security, and transparency. The criteria for inclusion are:

### Privacy policy and terms of user:
- Clarity and transparency of the policy
- Data collection and processing practices
- User control over data (e.g., deletion, modification)
        
### Code transparency
- Source Code Availability
- Community involvement and contribution opportunities
- Code auditability and transparency

### Trust and history:
- Age of the project and its maintainers
- User base and adoption rate
- Security track record (e.g.vulnerability disclosure, patching)
- Industry recognition and awards

### Security:
- End-to-end encryption implementation if possible
- Secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS, TLS)
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

### Anonymity
- Support for anonymous or pseudonymous usage
- Measures to protect user identities (e.g., IP address masking)  
- No [KYC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer)
